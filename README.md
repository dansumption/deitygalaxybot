# All The Deities

Deity Galaxy bot - [@deitygalaxybot](https://twitter.com/deitygalaxy) is a Twitter bot based on [Tracery](tracery.io). It tweets around once per hour, replies to mentions, and tries to remember which deity's tweet you've replied to so that it can again reference that deity.

I'd love contributions to the grammar - the stuff that the bots say. To help, just [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo), start making changes, and then submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request). I've started adding [Issues](https://github.com/dansumption/deitygalaxybot/issues) to this repo - feel free to check them out and work on them, but you may first want to read on and have a play around...

All of _deitygalaxybot's_ text is stored in the [grammar directory](grammar/).

* [story.js](grammar/story.js) contains the sentence templates for everything that the bot writes - think of these as a series of mini stories involving deities. I would be very grateful to anyone who could add some more!
* [index.js](grammar/index.js) is the first file loaded, and pulls in all of the vocabulary for the bot - nouns, verbs, names, places, times, ...
* [origin.js](grammar/origin.js) isn't much used - but it decides on different templates based upon whether this is a fresh tweet, or a reply to someone.
* The various subdirectories contain all of the different categories of words - so the [nouns directory](grammar/nouns/) contans loads of different categories of noun, [spacetime](grammar/spacetime) contains places (building types, places of worship, names of real and imaginary countries, towns, mountains, buildings...), times ('40 winks', 'the time it takes for a watched kettle to boil',...) and more. [actors](grammar/actors) is where deities, humans and animals get their names, professions, and pronouns.

Tracery allows for nested grammar - and there are quite a few places where you can see this in action.

* For example, in [festival.js](grammar/spacetime/festival.js), the following template:
  `"start of filming of the BBC series '#nounToPluralise.capitalizeAll#' #deityPlace#"`
  will be filled in randomly each time the script is run, to come up with variations like:
  * start of filming of the BBC series 'Fucking Meerkat' on Flesh Hovel Lane
  * start of filming of the BBC series 'Fatberg' in an eroded range of hills
  * start of filming of the BBC series 'Cornish Pastie' on the Orient Express
* Take a look at [name.js](grammar/actors/name.js) to see how grammar can be embedded and smooshed around to come up with deity-like names such as Weh or Ã†z or Phu'buxmie-iest or Ioqu'thor or Clieseph.
* My favourite daft detail in the whole lot is the bird name generator. Have a peek in [birds.js](grammar/nouns/birds.js) if you want to see how `"#adjective#-#birdBodyPlace# #birdAdjective# #birdType#"` gets converted to breeds like...
  * irridium-breasted mountain blackbird
  * fruity-capped interstellar chough
  * ringed-crowned emperor shag
  * perky-headed wood quail
  * virgin-legged space swift

To get started, create a `temp` directory and then run `npm run debug` - it will spit out a file `temp\debug.txt` with a lot of sample generated tweets in it. To alter the template used, checkout `debug.js`, and to really go deep, look at the files contained within the `grammar` directory.

The twitter side of things is a little more complex, and I'm leaving details out for now. I hosted _deitygalaxybot's_ grammar initially on [Cheap Bots, Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), but as the things I wanted to do with it grew (and my grammar JSON grew out of control) I built this version so I could host it myself on Heroku. I found [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@mattpopovich/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-simple-twitter-bot-super-fast-with-node-js-and-heroku-7b322dbb5dd3) super helpful.
